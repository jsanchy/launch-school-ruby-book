I like the documentation from ruby-doc.org because it seems to make
the information more accessible from the official documentation at
ruby-lang.org.

Also, RubyDoc.info looks pretty helpful as it gives documentation on
open source Ruby libraries. It also uses YARD, which is a tool I'd like
to learn to use.
