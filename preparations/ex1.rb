First, I entered the following commands in the terminal to
create the folder and files:

$ mkdir my_folder
$ cd my_folder
$ touch one.rb two.rb

Then I opened one.rb and two.rb in the text editor of my choice (Sublime),
so that the following terminal commands would produce:

$ cat one.rb
puts "this is file one"
$ ruby one.rb
this is file one
$ cat two.rb
puts "this is file two"
$ ruby two.rb
this is file two
=end
